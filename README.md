Safe and secure user sign-up and login handled by Firebase Authentication, with all interview data stored in Firestore.

üì± Fully Responsive Design

Practice anytime, anywhere. A seamless experience on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.

üöÄ The AI Magic: How It Works
Our goal was to create more than just a Q&A bot. Here‚Äôs a look at the AI pipeline that makes PrepViewAI so effective:

Initiate Call: The user starts an interview session from the UI, initiating a call with our Vapi AI Voice Assistant.

Conduct Interview: The assistant asks a series of pre-defined or dynamically generated questions, collecting the user's spoken responses.

Send to Backend: Once the interview is complete, Vapi ends the call and sends the full conversation transcript to a dedicated Next.js API endpoint in our backend.

Analyze with Gemini: Our API route securely feeds the transcript to the Google Gemini model for in-depth analysis.

Generate Feedback & Store: Gemini returns structured feedback on the user's performance. Our backend then stores the transcript and the AI feedback in the user's Firestore database document.

Display Results: The user is redirected to a results page where they can see their full transcript and the newly generated AI feedback.

üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
This project is built with a modern, AI-first technology stack.
